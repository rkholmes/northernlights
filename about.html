        <p><strong>Northern Lights</strong> was founded as a labor of love by Jan and Erika Hansen in 2012. As travel enthusiasts, they have traveled to 14 countries and counting. When they began suggesting travel itineraries to friends, Northern Lights was born. As Nordic natives, they are passionate about bringing the gems of their homeland to a wider audience. They are proud to have facilitated dozens of satisfying trips to northern Europe, and they hope to continue bringing joy for years to come!</p>
